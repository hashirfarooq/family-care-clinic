    <h3>Understanding Dengue: Symptoms, Treatment, and Prevention</h3>
    <p>
        Dengue fever is a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral infection that poses a serious public health challenge in many parts of the world, including South Asia. Caused by the bite of an <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito infected with the dengue virus, it can range from mild flu-like illness to severe and life-threatening conditions if not managed properly. Awareness about its symptoms, treatment, and preventive measures is essential to reducing the burden of this disease.
    </p>
    <button class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleReadMore(this)">Read More</button>

    <div class="read-more-text">
        <h4>Symptoms of Dengue</h4>
        <p>The symptoms of dengue usually appear 4–10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Common signs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High fever (up to 104°F)</li>
            <li>Severe headache and eye pain</li>
            <li>Muscle, joint, and bone pain (often called “breakbone fever”)</li>
            <li>Nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite</li>
            <li>Skin rashes and mild bleeding (such as nosebleeds or gum bleeding)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In severe cases, dengue can progress to <strong>dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)</strong> or <strong>dengue shock syndrome (DSS)</strong>, which require urgent medical attention. Warning signs include persistent abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, severe vomiting, or bleeding.
        </p>

        <h4>Treatment of Dengue</h4>
        <p>There is currently no specific antiviral treatment for dengue. Management focuses on supportive care:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adequate rest and hydration are crucial.</li>
            <li>Paracetamol can help reduce fever and relieve pain (avoid aspirin or ibuprofen as they increase bleeding risk).</li>
            <li>Close monitoring by healthcare professionals is necessary, especially for severe cases.</li>
            <li>Hospitalization may be required for patients with complications or severe symptoms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Early detection and timely medical care significantly reduce the risk of complications and fatalities.</p>

        <h4>Prevention of Dengue</h4>
        <p>Prevention remains the most effective way to control dengue. Key measures include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eliminate mosquito breeding sites:</strong> Empty standing water from containers, flowerpots, and tires.</li>
            <li><strong>Use mosquito repellents and nets:</strong> Apply insect repellents and sleep under nets, especially during early morning and evening when <em>Aedes</em> mosquitoes are most active.</li>
            <li><strong>Wear protective clothing:</strong> Long-sleeved shirts and pants reduce skin exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Community efforts:</strong> Public health campaigns, fumigation, and awareness drives play a vital role in reducing mosquito populations.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Kids Growth Guide: Height-Weight-Age Monitoring Chart</h3>
    <p>
        Monitoring your child’s height and weight is one of the simplest and most effective ways to track overall health, nutrition, and development. 
        Growth charts provide parents with a clear picture of how children are growing compared to standard averages. 
        This <strong>Height-Weight-Age Chart</strong> for boys and girls from birth to 12 years offers quick reference points 
        to ensure your child is on a healthy path.
    </p>
    <button class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleReadMore(this)">Read More</button>

    <div class="read-more-text">
        <h4>Why Growth Monitoring Matters</h4>
        <p>
            Regularly tracking your child’s growth helps identify whether they are developing normally. 
            It allows parents and doctors to catch nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, or medical conditions early. 
            More than just numbers, steady and consistent growth is a sign of good overall health.
        </p>

        <h4>How to Use the Chart</h4>
        <p>Follow these steps to make the best use of the monitoring chart:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Measure accurately:</strong> Use a reliable weighing scale and measure height without shoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Check age precisely:</strong> Compare your child’s exact age (months or years) with the chart values.</li>
            <li><strong>Look at trends:</strong> One reading doesn’t tell the full story; track over months to see steady progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Consult professionals:</strong> If growth falls significantly above or below the averages, seek medical advice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sample Average Values</h4>
        <p>Here are some key values from the chart:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>At birth:</strong> Boys 3.3kg & 50.5cm | Girls 3.3kg & 49.4cm</li>
            <li><strong>1 year:</strong> Boys 10.2kg & 76.1cm | Girls 9.5kg & 75cm</li>
            <li><strong>5 years:</strong> Boys 18.7kg & 109.9cm | Girls 17.7kg & 108.4cm</li>
            <li><strong>10 years:</strong> Boys 31.4kg & 137.5cm | Girls 32.5kg & 138.3cm</li>
            <li><strong>12 years:</strong> Boys 37kg & 147cm | Girls 38.7kg & 148cm</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These numbers represent averages, not exact targets. Some children may be naturally taller, shorter, lighter, or heavier while still being healthy.
        </p>

        <h4>Tips for Supporting Healthy Growth</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide a balanced diet with essential nutrients.</li>
            <li>Encourage daily physical activity and outdoor play.</li>
            <li>Ensure children get adequate sleep for recovery and growth.</li>
            <li>Maintain regular pediatric checkups and vaccinations.</li>
            <li>Teach healthy hydration habits from an early age.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Final Thought:</strong> Growth charts are tools to guide parents, not create stress. 
            Every child develops at their own pace. Consistency and healthy habits are more important than hitting exact numbers. 
            Use this chart as a friendly guide and consult a pediatrician if you notice unusual growth patterns.

    <h3>Breast Milk Handling and Storage Guidelines</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <button class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleReadMore(this)">Read More</button>

    <div class="read-more-text">
        <h4>1. Hygiene First</h4>
        <p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before expressing or handling breast milk.</p>

        <h4>2. Clean Containers</h4>
        <p>Use clean, BPA-free bottles or breast milk storage bags. Avoid glass containers with rubber tops.</p>

        <h4>3. Labeling</h4>
        <p>Always label containers with the date and time of expression. Use the oldest milk first.</p>

        <h4>4. Storage Guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>At room temperature (up to 25°C / 77°F): <b>Up to 4 hours</b></li>
            <li>In the refrigerator (≤4°C / 39°F): <b>Up to 4 days</b></li>
            <li>In the freezer (-18°C / 0°F or colder): <b>6 months (best), up to 12 months</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5. Thawing and Warming</h4>
        <p>
            Thaw frozen milk in the refrigerator overnight or by placing the container in warm water. 
            Do not refreeze thawed milk. Avoid microwaving as it destroys nutrients and may create hot spots.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Serving</h4>
        <p>Gently swirl the bottle to mix the separated fat. Never shake vigorously. Discard any leftover milk after feeding.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            By following these breast milk handling practices, you ensure your baby receives safe, high-quality nutrition. 
            Proper hygiene and storage help retain the milk’s valuable nutrients and antibodies.
